# CustomGallery

This is a test assignment for the Junior Android Developer position at Agora Software.
Implement a gallery that will display photos from Unsplash. 
The application must extract the resource in JSON format.

The application should contain two screens:

ListActivity
- a mini-image with the title and author;
- when the user clicks on the image, a screen with the photo opens.
  
FullPhotoActivity
- displays one photo with the maximum area.

In general, this task requires creating a custom gallery with Unsplash.
